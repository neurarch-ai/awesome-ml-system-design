# Contributing

Thanks for improving this book. A few house rules keep every chapter rendering
correctly on GitHub and reading consistently. CI runs the validator on every push
and pull request, so please run it locally before opening a PR.

## Before you push

```bash
node tools/validate-book.mjs
```

It must print `Book validation passed`. If it reports a problem, fix it and re-run.
The validator enforces the rules below (Node 24, no dependencies).

## House rules (enforced by CI)

- **No em or en dashes.** Use commas, periods, or parentheses. A `—` or `–` fails CI.
- **Math must be GitHub-KaTeX safe.** GitHub renders `$...$` and `$$...$$` with KaTeX,
  but its Markdown pass runs first, so a few characters need care:
  - Use `\ast` for a star/optimal superscript, never a literal `*` inside math (a
    bare `*` is eaten as Markdown emphasis and breaks the formula, e.g. write
    `B^{\ast}`, not `B^*`).
  - Use `\lt` / `\gt`, not a bare `<` or `>` before a letter.
  - Use `\text{...}`, not `\operatorname{...}`.
  - Escape literal dollar amounts as `\$` (for example `\$5,000`) so they do not pair
    with a real inline-math `$` and swallow the text between them.
- **Mermaid line breaks are `<br/>`, never `\n`.** A literal `\n` inside a mermaid
  block does not render.
- **Code fences balance.** Every ```` ``` ```` opens and closes.
- **Images live in the chapter's `assets/` folder**, and every
  `![...](assets/...)` reference must resolve to a file that exists.
- **Internal links resolve** to a file, a `file.md`, or a directory.
- **No duplicate section headings** within a single file.

## Citations

- Cite **real primary sources only**: arXiv abstract pages
  (`https://arxiv.org/abs/XXXX.XXXXX`), first-party company engineering blogs, or
  official docs.
- **Never invent** an arXiv ID, a benchmark number, a latency, or a
  "Company X uses Y" adoption claim. If you are unsure of an arXiv ID, name the
  method by author or organization and year instead of guessing a number.
- Re-check external links (arXiv, blogs, docs) with:

  ```bash
  node tools/check-links.mjs
  ```

  This is not part of the blocking push CI (external sites rate-limit and bot-block,
  which would make a gate flaky). A scheduled job runs it monthly, and you should run
  it yourself whenever you add or change links. It reports each link as OK, BLOCKED
  (a bot-block on a page that almost certainly exists), or DEAD (a 404, DNS failure,
  or TLS error) and fails only on DEAD.

## Chapter structure

Chapters live in `book/<slug>/` as one file per section (`01-clarifying-requirements`
through `09-summary`, plus a `README.md` index). A chapter opens with a
Candidate/Interviewer dialogue to scope the problem, then follows a
frame-data-model-evaluate-serve arc, and closes with a production section (with
first-party links), an interview Q&A, and a summary. Figures are worked matplotlib
PNGs in `assets/` and mermaid diagrams. Keep additions tight and mechanism-focused
rather than padded.

A companion book covers the LLM half in the
[LLM System Design](https://github.com/neurarch-ai/awesome-llm-system-design)
repository.
