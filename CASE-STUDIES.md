# Production case studies, by topic

The same landscape of shipped ML systems that the broad indexes catalog
(the [Evidently AI ML system design database](https://www.evidentlyai.com/ml-system-design)
is the widest, 800 case studies from 150+ companies), re-organized into this
repo's own taxonomy and presented our way: every entry is a first-party
engineering writeup with a verified link, tagged by what it actually shows you
(*who it serves* / *product design* / *eval bar* / *deployment*).

This is a roll-up of the **Seen in production** section inside each topic, so you
can browse the whole set by category in one place. 115 systems and growing.
